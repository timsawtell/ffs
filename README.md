ffs
===

perl script to generate table throw text, e.g. $ ffs.pl "rage quit" will copy to your clipboard (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡 ʇınb ǝƃɐɹ

Requires Perl

copy ffs.pl to somewhere on your PATH, i.e. /usr/bin/ffs.pl

I create an alias in my ~/.bash_profile 
alias ffs='ffs.pl'

then whenever I get the shits and need to tell people about it in a sarcastic way I bring up terminal

ffs "what the fuck use better commit messages"

and bingo my clipboard now has
